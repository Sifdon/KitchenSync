=================

Kitchen Sync was my senior project at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and it's a grocery list application for Android that syncs with Google Docs.

Easily manage your grocery list on both Google Docs and on your Android device. Additional quality of life improvements coming soon, and more features as well!

When you first launch the app, it should ask you for permission to use your Google account so that it can sync with Google Docs. After permission has been granted, it will create a Google Doc Spreadsheet called Kitchen Sync Grocery List, and that is where you can add/edit your grocery list from your computer. The app will sync with Google Docs whenever you start the app or hit refresh in the Grocery List view.

Please let me know of any problems you encounter, or features you would like to see. I'll try to implement them when I can!
